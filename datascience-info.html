<h1>Information for DAT-MS/ML-CGS/TDA-CGS applicants</h1>

<div id="main">
Here you will find answers to some common questions that should resolve most inquiries.  First, a basic introduction and a list of main graduate resources.

<h3>Data science programs and application process</h3>

You can follow links to the three data science focused degree programs available in the Mathematics and Statistics Department: <a href="https://www.albany.edu/math/programs/ms-data-science">MS in Data Science</a>, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/math/programs/cgs-machine-learning">Machine Learning CGS</a>, and <a href="https://www.albany.edu/math/programs/cgs-topological-data-analysis">Topological Data Analysis CGS</a>.
Each program page includes a link to the program curriculum and to the list of required application materials.
You will find on that page a link to the step-by-step application process.
<br>
There are some specifics about applying as an international student.
See the details at <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/international-applicants.php">International Applications</a> (scroll to the bottom of that page for additional topics).
<br>
There is also an option for an undergraduate mathematics major to enroll in a Combined Degree Program.
For details see the mathematics/statistics/data science <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_combined_baccalaureate_masters.htm">combined degrees page</a>.
<br>
Once you are admitted, here is a good collection of answered questions: <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/admissions/information-admitted-students">Admitted Student Q/A</a>.
A different page designed for international students but useful for everyone is here: <a href="https://www.albany.edu/isss/new_students.php">New students information and orientation</a>.
If you have questions for graduate admissions, you can contact the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate">Graduate School</a> directly.

<h3>Common questions and answers</h3>
<dl>
<dt>What is the minimum preparation I need to start the DAT-MS or a certificate program?</dt>
<dd>There is no restriction on educational background for successful applications.  We require a standard sequence of 3 semesters of calculus, including multivariable calculus (MAT 214 in Albany), a course in linear algebra (MAT 220), statistics (MAT 108), and ideally another class on basics of discrete mathematics.  The more extensive math background you have the easier the initial graduate classes will be.  Please understand that finishing this preparation is not a guarantee of admission.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Do I need to take GRE?</dt>
<dd>The list of required documents is listed in the program pages linked above.  None of data science programs requires GRE scores.  But if you have taken GRE and would like to share the scores with us, please go ahead and upload the scores in the application.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Does the department provide financial support and application fee waiver?</dt>
<dd>All of the assistantship lines in our department are reserved for the PhD students but here are some university-wide resources.  This is the Graduate School page about <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/funding-graduate-studies">funding graduate studies</a>.  There is a link within that page for
  <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/funding-graduate-studies/graduate-teaching-assistant-vacancies">University-wide GA/TA lines</a>.
  Regarding the application fee waiver, you can see if you qualify and then request it through the same page
  <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/funding-graduate-studies">funding graduate studies</a>.
   Go to "Application Fee Waivers" and you will find information on who qualifies, the link to download the form to request the waiver, and more info. Please email <TT>diversitygraduate@albany.edu</TT> with any further questions regarding this as this waiver is handled by the graduate admissions office, not by individual departments.
</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Does "rolling admission" mean I can apply any time?</dt>
<dd>Yes, indeed, you can apply as early as two years in advance and as late as a couple weeks before the academic year starts.  Our admission decisions are made by the data science committee within 2-3 weeks of receiving a complete application.  There is no hard deadline but if you are an international student, the graduate admissions office will start the immigration process only after you accept your admission and pay your tuition deposit.
</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>I am an international student, is this program STEM designated?</dt>
<dd>Each of the three data science degree is designated as a STEM program. International students maintaining F-1 status are allowed to apply for post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) following completion/graduation from their degree program.  During the study one can participate in Curricular Practical Training (CPT).  See more details in each program linked at the top of this page.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Why does my issued I-20 say my program is "applied mathematics"?</dt>
<dd>The correct name of the degree is MS in Data Science.  The issue is with the US immigration service.  They don’t have a data science designation in a sort of drop-down menu list of degrees.  So we’ve been using applied mathematics as the closest degree name for all immigration purposes: I-20, CPT, OPT, for many years.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>I have been admitted, what should I do next?</dt>
<dd>The email from graduate admissions that brought you the good news and congratulated you should have instructions for accepting your admission and paying a tuition deposit.  Once you do that, you will be cleared to be advised by our Data Science Team.  We will send you detailed information about the classes to take, everything you need to enroll in them, orientation plans, etc. some time in the middle of April when the Fall pre-registartion starts and your first semester classes are set up for enrollment. </dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Where do I find names and descriptions of the courses?</dt>
<dd>The courses in Albany have prefixes such as AMAT and others.  AMAT means it's a course offered by the Mathematics and Statistics department in the College of Arts and Sciences (that's where A comes from).  Here is a page with <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/a_mat.htm">Courses in Mathematics and Statistics</a> from the Graduate Bulletin.  You can also search for offerings from other departments in the same bulletin. </dd>
