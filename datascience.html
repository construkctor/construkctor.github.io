<h1>Advisement hub for DAT-MS/ML-CGS/TDA-CGS</h1>

<div id="main">
This hub is to help data science students navigate through the programs in data science offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  The program is managed by the Data Science Team that can be reached by sending an email to <TT>datascience@albany.edu</TT>.  After a summary of basic information, half-way through the page start some Q&As that address common inquiries and requests.

<h3>Data science program pages and advisement</h3>

We offer three data science focused degree programs: <a href="https://www.albany.edu/math/programs/ms-data-science">MS in Data Science</a>, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/math/programs/cgs-machine-learning">Machine Learning CGS</a>, and <a href="https://www.albany.edu/math/programs/cgs-topological-data-analysis">Topological Data Analysis CGS</a>.
Each program page includes a link to the program curriculum (see the link to the Graduate Bulletin).
<br>
Graduation requirements for each program are a list of courses that need to be taken in order to graduate with a degree.
<br>
Since most of the courses are organized into sequences, that essentially locks one into a well-defined schedule over several semesters.
<br>
For the MS program, the standard schedule consisting of the minimum required 36 credits looks like so:
<br>
&#0151; <i>Fall semester, 1st year:</i> AMAT 500, 502, 554 <br>
&#0151; <i>Spring semester, 1st year:</i> AMAT 583, 591, + one of 522, 560, 565, 581 <br>
&#0151; <i>Fall semester, 2nd year:</i> AMAT 584, 592, + one of 522, 560, 565, 581 <br>
&#0151; <i>Spring semester, 2nd year:</i> AMAT 585 or 593 (one of the practicums has to be taken), + one/two of 522, 560, 565, 581<br>

You should expect to receive an advisement email from our Team a week before the pre-registration period (either middle of October or middle of March, depending on the season) with a reminder of which classes to take in the next semester.  The email will include your required personal AVN number.<br>


<h3>Common questions and answers</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Am I required to take a practicum?</dt>
<dd>Yes.  A practicum course is required as a capstone class in the MS program.  You should take either AMAT 585 or AMAT 593, in your last semester in Albany.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>What about doing an internship?</dt>
<dd>No. There is no internship requirement in any of data science programs.  However, many students in the program get summer internships and occasionally internships during regular semesters. Albany is the capital of New York State, and the state offices are offering great internship opportunities to domestic and international students. There are also local tech companies that offer internships. The best way for current students to search and find internships is through the <a href="https://career.albany.edu/resources/handshake/">Handshake platform</a>.  (The same is true about jobs on campus.)</dd>
<dd>For details about the internship approval process for international students, refer to the very last question at the bottom of this page.  Note: international students are eligible for CPT only after one year of academic study, unless the job is on campus.</dd>

<dt>Does the department provide support?</dt>
<dd>All of the assistantship lines in our department are reserved for the PhD students but here are some university-wide resources.  This is the Grad School page about <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/funding-graduate-studies">funding graduate studies</a>.
  There is a link within that page for
  <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate/funding-graduate-studies/graduate-teaching-assistant-vacancies">University-wide GA/TA lines</a>.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Can I expedite my progress through the program?</dt>
<dd>That is possible only to a limited extent, for example by taking advantage of courses in the program offered in 4-week winter and summer sessions in online format.  Those courses are AMAT 522, 565, 583, 584, 591, 592.  There are two caveats: not every course is guaranteed to be offered every summer or winter, and you still need to be on campus to take a practicum in your 4th semester.  However that practicum can be your only course that semester, possibly combined with an internship or a local job.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Is it possible to take courses other than the ones listed in the program?</dt>
<dd>You may have interests in other fields where you plan to apply the data science skills.  Your AVN allows you to enroll in additional classes offered by other departments on campus.  Examples are a data mining course from the CS department or a database course from the School of Business.  It's your responsibility to get into those classes that may have program restrictions just as our data science courses do.  If you have difficulties adding a class not labeled “AMAT” you can contact the instructor of the course.  There is no need for a pre-approval from the Data Science Team.  However, these graduate credits will be <b>outside of your degree program</b>.  They will not be part of the minimum graduation requirements of 36 credits in DAT-MS.  </dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>What are satisfactory grades in my courses?</dt>
<dd>All UAlbany graduate programs have the requirement that the graduation GPA is 3.0 or higher, and if there is a capstone course (which is either AMAT 585 or AMAT 593 in DAT-MS), that capstone has to be completed with a grade B or better.
An excerpt about satisfactory grades from <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm">Graduate Regulations and Degree Requirements</a>:
“According to graduate academic standards, only courses completed with grades of A, A-, B+, B, and S may be applied to graduate course requirements and to credit requirements for graduate degrees. These requirements can also be met by courses graded B-, C+, and C only if they are balanced to a B (3.0). (Example: Three credits of B- must be balanced at least by three credits of B+).”
There is a table of the grade scale that you can use to convert letter grades to point equivalencies for GPA in <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduate-bulletin/regulations-and-degree-requirements.php#heading-accordion-185286-24">this jump link</a>.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>What is the mode of instruction in the MS program?</dt>
<dd>Most courses are offered as in-person classes.  A few courses would have sections that are taught asynchronously online.  That's done to accommodate professionals studying part-time and certificate students who are not in Albany.  You can take an online version of the course if there is a seat.  The content is exactly the same as other sections. There is another mode called <i>hybrid</i>.  When you enroll in such section you will see a statement of when the students are required to be in the classroom, usually 1 or 2 times each month.  Otherwise the instruction is done online.  International students should have been warned by ISSS that the Immigration Service rules require that at least 2 classes each regular Fall or spring semester are taken NOT online. In this respect, hybrid classes are equivalent to in-person classes.</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>Any advice on how to begin a job search in data science after completing the program?</dt>
<dd>Data Science field has created some hiring practices that are different from more traditional modes of hiring.  For example, while responding to job postings and/or working with a head-hunter are still a thing, very often companies scrub the web or LinkedIn for what they are looking for instead.  We recommend establishing your online presence with a well-designed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> profile and a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>  page with projects that demonstrate your skills and expertise.  We think you should include selected assignments and projects from courses in the program.  Also, a huge array of services is available from the <a href="https://career.albany.edu/">Career and Professional Development office</a>.
</dd>
<dd> </dd>

<dt class="next">What is the process of approving internship for international students?</dt>
<dd>An international student who has secured an internship offer has to go through a process that's called CPT (Curricular Professional Training) guided by <a href="https://www.albany.edu/isss/">ISSS</a>.  To start the process, the first step is to contact ISSS.  In particular, you will be directed to fill out a CPT approval form and enroll in an "internship course" during the actual internship.  In this program that role is played by the course AMAT 697, taken for 1 credit.  This course can be repeated for as many semesters or summers or winters that coincide with your internship.  Once you are ready, fill out the student portion of CPT Academic Advisor Authorizaon Form and email it to the Data Science Team at <TT>datascience@albany.edu</TT>. In return, you will receive back the signed form and information on how to enroll in AMAT 697.
</dd>
<dd>(1) Please refer to <a href="https://www.albany.edu/international-student-scholar-services/cpt-work-authorization">CPT information</a> for all details.  ISSS is the primary resource who will help you with CPT paperwork.  All questions are best answered by them.  (2) The course AMAT 697 can be used only to satisfy the immigration service requirement of being enrolled in an internship course concurrently with an internship; it cannot be used to satisfy any graduation requirement in your program.
